# YouTube Anti-Block

*Unblock your YouTube ad blocker.*

## How to use?

Add the URL below as a filter in any ad blocker.

```
https://github.com/KaioHSG/youtube-anti-block/raw/main/youtube-anti-block.txt
```

Or, download and import the [`YouTube-Anti-Block.txt`](https://github.com/KaioHSG/youtube-anti-block/releases/latest) file.

## Note

This filter wasn't made by me, in fact I don't even know who created it. I just modified it and made it available.
