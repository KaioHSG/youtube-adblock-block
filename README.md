# YouTube Anti-Block

*Unblock your YouTube ad blocker.*

## How to use?

Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaioHSG/youtube-anti-block/main/youtube-anti-block.text` as a filter in any ad block.

Or, download and import the `youtube-anti-block.text` file.

## Note

This filter wasn't made by me, in fact I don't even know who created it. I just modified it and made it available.
